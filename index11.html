<p id="paral">I decided that my web page about food. My web page will be about diffrent kinds of cultural foods. This is just an idea I dont know if I might really stick with it but I do enjoy cooking. But now that I am in college I've had to get creative with the ways I continue to cook in a safe way. <br> I think that I'll have a section where I include dorm safe college recipies. I'll also have sections that talk about national dishes from where im from which is the Dominican republic. As well as national dishes from diffrent places.</p>  
<ul>
<li> national dishes </li>
<li> Easy college dishes </li>
</ul>
